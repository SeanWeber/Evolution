Evolution
=========

Cellular life simulator in HTML5

*Evolution* aims to be a tool that demonstrates the concept of Natural Selection. Each cell has attributes, such as speed and vision, which determine how effectively it can find food. 

As the experiment runs, data about the cell population is displayed. In addition, clicking a cell gives information about the individual cell.
